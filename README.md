Abstract

Gathering and analyzing data during an incident can be a long and tedious process. The vast amounts of data involved in even a single system intrusion can be overwhelming. Larger and well-funded incident response teams typically have a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) product at their disposal to help the responder sift through this data to find artifacts relevant to the intrusion. This paper will demonstrate to the reader how to use Microsoft Excel and some of its more advanced features during an intrusion if a SIEM or similar product is not available to the incident responder.
